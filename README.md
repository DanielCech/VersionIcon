### Dependency Managers
<details>
  <summary><strong>CocoaPods</strong></summary>

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate DeallocTests into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'VersionIcon', :git=>'https://github.com/DanielCech/VersionIcon.git', :tag => 'v1.0.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

</details>

## Usage

* Create a new Run Script Phase in Build Settings > Build Phases in your app
* Use this shell script:
```shell
if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" = "Release" ]; then
    "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin/VersionIcon" --resources "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin" --original
else
    "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin/VersionIcon" --ribbon Blue.png --title Devel.png --resources "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin" --strokeWidth 0.07
fi
```
* If your projects contains different configuration names, you'll need to adjust the script.
* Move this script phase above the Copy Bundle Resources phase.
