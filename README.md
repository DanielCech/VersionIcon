A simple tool that can add an icon overlay with app version to your iOS app icon. Overlays can include the ribbon with app version (_Dev_, _Staging_, _Production_, _MVP_...) and/or version number. The icon overlays can be customized many ways. You can also use your own graphic resources. The VersionIcon tool is distributed in binary form, so it is independent on your project setup.

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.0+

## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate VersionIcon into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'VersionIcon', '~> 1.0.3'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage

* Make a duplicate of your app icon resource in asset catalog - let's have for example _AppIcon_ and _AppIconOriginal_. The copy is used as a backup. Production builds typically have no icon overlays. 
* Create a new Run Script Phase in Build Settings > Build Phases in your app
* Use this shell script:
```shell
if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" = "Release" ]; then
    "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin/VersionIcon" --resources "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin" --original
else
    "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin/VersionIcon"  --ribbon Blue-TopRight.png --title Devel-TopRight.png --resources "Pods/VersionIcon/Bin" --strokeWidth 0.07
fi
```
* If your projects contains different configuration names, you'll need to adjust the script.
* Move this script phase above the Copy Bundle Resources phase.
* If you need to use your own ribbon or title asset, you can specify full path to image file

## Parameters
* Full description of parameters is available when you run VersionIcon with `--help` parameter
```
